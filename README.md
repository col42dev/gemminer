# gemminer

gemminer is a sim resource trading app. Resources state data is loaded on start-up. Resources can be brought or sold for gold. 
This trading is restricted by resource quantities and available gold. There is a 'cheat quantity' button for each resource type.
Trade transactions are stored and can be submitted to the [server](https://github.com/col42dev/gemrefractor) using the SubmitTransaction button.
The server will apply the transaction to corresponding state data and repond with a result if it determines cheats have been used.
